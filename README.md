This is a home assignment to create an Investor Relations web app that fetches press releases from the MFN API and to display it nicely in the web app. The press releases should have list mode, full/single mode and report archive mode. In list mode, the user should be able to choose/filter by press release type (IR or public relations) and some different kind of releases (for example: regulatory, annual reports, interim report).

Thoughts before starting with the project:
- Use json link
- Write web app in React
